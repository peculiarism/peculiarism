## Hey fellow Earthlings 👋🏻

![Welcome!](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1adb0-Ls9NSEFPvk8mXSjuLRK2cPwUtyb)

I'm [Beth](https://linkedin.com/in/beth-glenfield), a former Software Engineer turned Product Manager at Puppet. My life motto is to lead with curiosity, so I also moonlight as a Director for [Women Who Code](https://womenwhocode.com/belfast), a scout for a VC fund, and a co-founder for a [medtech](https://www.linkedin.com/company/pillpocket/about/) startup. Outside of my side hustles you will likely find me binging K-dramas or reading fantasy novels. You can find me tweeting about tech [here](https://twitter.com/_peculiarism).
